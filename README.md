# generator
NSA proof password generator using Diceware wordlist as based on The Intercept article [Passphrases That You Can Memorize — But That Even the NSA Can’t Guess](https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/).

# How to run
This script is designed to be executed in RStudio, with both files in the same RStudio Project folder.

# Default strength
The default password strength is 8 letters, which works out one in 7776^8 (or 1.336749e+31) of guessing your password.

# How to use
Execute last line to get words. Always save workspace environment when exiting from R as rerunning the code from the previous workspace will result in the same output of word combinations.

Write down code on a piece of paper, and type into input until the password becomes instinctual. Destroy paper by burning, pulping, or any other method that ensures the only copy of the password remaining, is the one in your head.

Change password as needed.
